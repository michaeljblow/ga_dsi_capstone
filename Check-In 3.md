1. Do you have data fully in hand and if not, what blockers are you facing?<br>
Yes, no blockers are in place as I am using my own proprietary data.

2. Have you done a full EDA on all of your data?<br>
Not quite. I am building a CNN and significant time is being spent organizing 30,000 images to a more manageable number as well as creating classes. 

3. Have you begun the modeling process? How accurate are your predictions so far?<br>
No. I expect to have a first model by 3/5/2020.

4. What blockers are you facing, including processing power, data acquisition, modeling difficulties, data cleaning, etc.? How can we help you overcome those challenges?<br>
None. I have extensive Adobe software at my disposal for organizing data. I have also spent significant time configuring my at-home desktop PC and GPU for neural network processing. I am extremely optimistic about getting models going and running several iterations.

5. Have you changed topics since your lightning talk? Since you submitted your Problem Statement and EDA? If so, do you have the necessary data in hand (and the requisite EDA completed) to continue moving forward?<br>
Yes, 6 times since the lightning talk but not since the EDA was recently submitted. All signs are positive to keep moving forward though.

6. What is your timeline for the next week and a half? What do you have to get done versus what would you like to get done?<br>
By 3/7/2020, have models run and confident in the final product to present on. Also needed in 10 days are one quiz, two labs, and 1-2 blog posts (one is complete but yet to be published).

7. What topics do you want to discuss during your 1:1?<br>
Does this capstone problem seem to niche? I struggled to get data for the first several capstone ideas. I am excited about this project though because I would like to showcase my deep learning/neural network skills and did not get to this with the client project.

8. We will use your progress report as a leaping off point for a deep 1:1 with a member of the instructional staff. The best use of your time is to really flesh out this document so that your remaining time here can be most productive.<br>
Looking forward to it.
